# Bank Systm 
A program used to track the movement of money between customers and their accounts. It is a mini project based on an ATM
Withdrawing, depositing, and transferring funds, all these main tasks are included in this small program, while maintaining confidentiality
I listened to the encryption and decryption, and all of that on the file
